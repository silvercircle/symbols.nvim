# symbols.nvim

Code navigation sidebar. Instantly find your way around any file.

## Features

- **Listing Symbols** - uses LSP servers and Treesitter parsers.
- **Fuzzy Search** - quickly find symbols.
- **Preview Window** - peek at code before jumping, edit in place if needed.
- **Symbol Details** - display symbol details inline or in a pop-up for extra context.
- **Dynamic Settings** - change settings on the fly without restarting Neovim.
- **Custom Display Rules** - configurable filtering and display formatting per language.
- **Preserving Folds** - keeps your sidebar folds in tact on updates (most of the time).
- **Mouse Support** - works with mouse.

# Requirements

- Neovim 0.10+
- LSP servers for desired languages
- Treesitter parsers (see [Supported Languages](#supported-languages))

# Quick Start

Using lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
    "oskarrrrrrr/symbols.nvim",
    config = function()
        local r = require("symbols.recipes")
        require("symbols").setup(r.DefaultFilters, r.AsciiSymbols, {
            -- custom settings here
            -- e.g. hide_cursor = false
        })
        vim.keymap.set("n", ",s", "<cmd> Symbols<CR>")
        vim.keymap.set("n", ",S", "<cmd> SymbolsClose<CR>")
    end
}
```

> **Warning**
>
> The main branch is used for development and may introduce breaking changes without warning.
> For a more stable experience use tags (e.g. "v0.1.0") with you plugin manager.

# Supported Languages

There are two sources of symbols that are displayed in the sidebar:
1. LSP servers configured by the user (for example with [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim))
2. Treesitter parsers installed by the user (for example with `TSInstall` command)

Virtually any LSP server should work with the sidebar.

Languages supported through treesitter (Treesitter parser name in brackets):
- Markdown (markdown)
- Vimdoc (vimdoc)
- Org (org)
- JSON (json)
- JSON Lines (json)
- Makefile (make)

When a language is supported by both sources, the LSP servers take precedence
over Treesitter.

# Tips

## Help

Press `?` in the sidebar to see the available keymaps or run `:help symbols`.

## Fuzzy Search

Press `s` to start a fuzzy search. Use `<S-Tab>` and `<Tab>` to go up and down
the search results list without leaving the prompt window or navigate the search
history with `<C-j>` and `<C-k>`. Go to symbol with `<Cr>` or press `<Esc>` to
focus the search results window and peek symbols with `o`. Press `<Esc>` again
to go back to the symbols list or press `q` to close the sidebar.

## Preview Window

Press the preview window keymap (by default "K") once to open it, the second
time to jump to it. You can now move around the buffer and make changes. Press
"q" to close the window or jump to the sidebar if auto preview is on. Yes, this
means that by default you can't record macros in the preview window.

## Keymaps

How to remove a default keymap? Just set the value to `nil`.

## Dynamic Settings

A lot of settings can be changed on the fly by using keymaps starting with "t".
For example, try out "td" to toggle inline details, "t=" to toggle sidebar auto
resizing or "tp" to toggle auto preview.

## Inline Details

By pressing "td" you can show inline details which are provided by some LSP
servers. They give useful information about certain symbols. For instance, for
a function the details might be the function params, for a variable it might be
the initial value.
Examples of languages that have nice support for details are Lua, Go and Rust.
On the flip side, Javascript and Python do not show any details.

## Navigation

Sometimes you want to get to a deeply nested symbol and unfold all the symbols
on the way. To do that for the symbol under the cursor in the source window
press "gs" when in the sidebar. Other useful mappings for more advanced
navigation are:

- "\[\[" and "\]\]" to go to the previous and next symbol on the same
  level. Can be used with a count.
- "gp" to go to parent symbol, can be used with a count.
- "L"/"zO" and "H"/"zC" for recursively opening and closing folds under the
  cursor . Useful for changing only part of the tree, whereas "zr", "zR", "zm"
  and "zM" affect the whole tree.

You can navigate the sidebar with a mouse. Left click to select a symbol,
double click to toggle fold, right click to peek the symbol.

# Commands

- `:Symbols[!]` A command designed to be used as your main mapping. Opens the
  Symbols sidebar and jumps to it unless called with the bang (`!`). If called
  when the sidebar is already open then jumps to it regardless of the bang.
  When called in a sidebar jumps back to the source code.
- `:SymbolsToggle[!]` An alternative main mapping. Opens the sidebar and jumps
  to it unless called with the bang (`!`). Closes the sidebar if already open.
- `:SymbolsOpen[!]` Opens the sidebar and jumps to it unless called with the
  bang (`!`).
- `:SymbolsClose` Closes the sidebar.

# Configuration

To use the plugin you must run the setup function: `require("symbols").setup()`.
Setup function takes any number of config arguments which will be merged with
the default config.

There are a few predefined recipes (configs) that you can use:

- DefaultFilters - filters out excessive symbols. For example, the Lua LSP
  server provides a symbol for each `if`, `elseif`, `else` and `for` and they
  are discarded by this config.
- AsciiSymbols - symbol kind displayed as text. For instance, "Function" kind 
  might be displayed as "fun", "fn", "func" or "def" depending on the language.
- FancySymbols - symbol kind will be displated as an icon. Needs `lspkind.nvim`.

The recipes are available in `symbols.recipes` module.

# API

There is now a (currently very simple) API available to control the Sidebar from LUA

```lua
  ---perform any action defined in SidebarAction
  ---@param act SidebarAction[]
  action = function(act)
    vim.validate({ act = { act, "string" } })
    local sidebar = apisupport_getsidebar()
    if sidebar ~= nil and sidebar_actions[act] ~= nil then
      sidebar_actions[act](sidebar)
    end
  end,
  ---manually refresh the symbols in the current sidebar
  refresh_symbols = function()
    local sidebar = apisupport_getsidebar()
    if sidebar ~= nil then
      sidebar:refresh_symbols()
    end
  end
```
The available actions can be obtained by calling

```lua
=require("symbols.config").SidebarAction
```

For example, to unfold the entire tree you would call:

```lua
require("symbols").api.action("unfold-all")
```
